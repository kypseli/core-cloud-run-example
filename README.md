# core-cloud-run-example
Example of deploying to Google Cloud Run from CloudBees Core on GKE.

- Leverages [GKE Workload Identity](https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/how-to/workload-identity) as the recommended way to access Google Cloud services from within GKE.
- If Core is not running on GKE then it is recommended to set-up a GKE cluster for Jenkins agents.
